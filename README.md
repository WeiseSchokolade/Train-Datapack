# Train Datapack

This is part of a datapack which I'm creating for a minecraft project.
It simulates a train which still works in unloaded chunks, making it a pretty safe system.
I do not recommend running it on its own since it requires a resource pack and some Scoreboards that are not created here, like the Math scoreboard.
I uploaded this repository so you can learn something or give tips.

To see how the movement system works, go to https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/719221106/ and follow the instructions.
